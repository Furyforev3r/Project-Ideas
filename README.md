| **8 - Dice Roller!**             | A dice roller is a project that simulates the rolling of dice. It involves creating a program or application that generates random numbers within a specified range to mimic the outcome of rolling dice. The dice roller can be designed to handle different types of dice, such as standard six-sided dice (d6) or other dice with various numbers of sides (e.g., d4, d8, d20). Users can interact with the dice roller by selecting the type and quantity of dice they want to roll. The program will then generate random numbers corresponding to each die and display the results to the user. The project can also include additional features like the ability to calculate the sum of all rolled dice or keep track of previous rolls. The dice roller project is often used in board games, role-playing games, or any other situation where random numbers are needed. It provides a convenient and reliable way to simulate dice rolling digitally, eliminating the need for physical dice and ensuring fair and unbiased results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Beginner** |

| **11 - CRUD API!**               | A CRUD API (Create, Read, Update, Delete API) is a project that involves creating an application programming interface (API) to perform basic database operations on resources. The CRUD operations represent the fundamental actions that can be performed on data: creating (adding), reading (retrieving), updating (modifying), and deleting (removing) resources. The CRUD API provides endpoints or URLs that developers can use to interact with the underlying database or data storage system. Each endpoint corresponds to a specific resource or collection of resources and supports the corresponding CRUD operation. For example, the API might have endpoints like /users to manage user resources, where a POST request creates a new user, a GET request retrieves user information, a PUT request updates user details, and a DELETE request removes a user from the system. The project involves designing the API's structure and endpoints, implementing the necessary code to handle the CRUD operations, and integrating it with a database or data storage system. The API should handle data validation, authentication, authorization, and error handling to ensure the security and integrity of the data. A CRUD API is widely used in web and mobile applications to provide a standardized interface for managing data resources. It enables developers to create, retrieve, update, and delete data using HTTP methods, allowing seamless interaction between client applications and the underlying data storage system. | **Beginner** |
