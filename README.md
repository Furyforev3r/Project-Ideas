| **1 - A Guess the Number Game!** | "Guess the Number Game" is an interactive game project where players try to guess a specific number chosen by the computer. The game starts with the computer generating a random number within a predetermined range. The player makes a guess, and the computer provides clues if the guess was too high or too low. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number or reaches a maximum number of attempts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Beginner** |
| **2 - Password Generator!**      | A password generator is a project that generates strong and secure passwords. It is designed to create complex passwords that are difficult for others to guess or crack. The generator typically takes into account various factors, such as password length, character types (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters), and the option for including or excluding certain characters. The generated passwords can be used for online accounts, applications, or any other situation where a secure password is needed to protect sensitive information. The password generator project aims to enhance security and promote good password practices by providing users with randomly generated, strong passwords.                                | **Beginner** |
| **3 - Rock Paper Scissors!**     | "Rock Paper Scissors" is a classic game project that simulates the popular hand game played between two players. The game involves three hand gestures: rock (a closed fist), paper (an open hand), and scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended). Each gesture can either win, lose, or result in a tie against the other gestures. The players make their choices simultaneously, and the winner is determined based on the following rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. The project involves creating a user interface where players can select their moves, and the computer or another player responds with their choice. It's a fun and simple project that showcases the principles of logic and decision-making. | **Beginner** |
| **4 - QRCode generator!**        | A QR Code generator is a project that creates Quick Response (QR) codes, which are two-dimensional barcodes that can store various types of information. The generator takes input from the user, such as text, URLs, contact information, or other data, and converts it into a QR Code. The QR Code can be scanned by smartphones or other devices equipped with QR Code readers to retrieve the encoded information. This project typically involves algorithms to encode the data into a QR Code format and generate the corresponding graphical representation. It can be useful for businesses, marketing campaigns, or personal purposes, allowing users to easily share information in a visually compact and scannable format.                                          | **Beginner** |
